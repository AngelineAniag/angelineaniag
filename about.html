                <p>    My name is Angeline Sta Ana Aniag. I was born in Culiat, Ibaan, Batangas. My parents 
                   are Marie Ann Sta Ana and Arturo Lajom Aniag. My older brother is Christian Aron Aniag, and my 
                   younger brother is Sanjie Piopongco. My mother is the one who takes care of me and my brothers while

                <p>I attended Paaralang Sentral ng Mataasnakahoy from kindergarten to grade 5, but eventually I transferred 
                    to Bolbok Elementary School, and I graduated there. I completed my junior high school at San Pascual National 
                    High School. In March 2019, I completed my senior high school at AMA Computer College Batangas Campus. I am currently a 3rd year 
                    college student at Batangas State University taking a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology majoring in
                   Business Analytics.
