                    <h2>Kpop</h2>
                    <p>I have been a K-pop fan since 2016. The first group that I discovered was Bigbang, but EXO got me. My bias is Park Chanyeol and my bias wrecker is DO Kyungsoo. I am also a carat, engene, and nctzen.</p>

                    <h2>Reading</h2>
                    <p>One of my favorite hobbies is reading (especially Jonaxx stories). Reading is my escape and home. It gives me the comfort and peace that I need. My favorite author is Jonah Mae Pacala, also known as Jonaxx. I have been a huge fan of hers since I was in 8th grade. I now have 3 collections of her books.</p>

                    <h2>Watching</h2>
                    <p>I also love watching cdramas and kdramas. They are also my comfort and escape every time. I prefer xianxia in Chinese dramas and historicals in Korean dramas. One of my favorite kdramas of all time is Reply 1988, and in Cdrama was Ashes of Love.</p>
